# 🐞 Bug Report

**Bug Type**: Critical

---

## 🔁 Playback Steps:
1. Extracted the provided installer.
2. Ran `broken_installer.exe` — only works if `Config` folder is present.
3. Attempted to run `debug.exe` inside `Config` — fails silently.
4. Reviewed `installation_path_code.js`, found this line:
   ```js
   <%= variable %> = installation_path();
   ```
5. This is invalid JavaScript and indicates improper build templating.

---

## 🧠 Analysis:
The game contains raw, uncompiled template code (`<%= %>`), which is not executable JavaScript.

This breaks the `installation_path_code.js` and may contribute to startup failure.

Additionally, `debug.exe` appears broken or non-functional without required code dependencies.

## 📸 Screenshot:
(Attach screenshots of folder & the faulty code if required)

---

## ✅ Recommendation:
- Fix the templating engine or replace `<%= variable %>` with valid JavaScript, e.g.:
  ```js
  const variable = installation_path();
  ```
- Add file/folder existence checks before attempting execution.
- Ensure `debug.exe` handles missing components gracefully (or provide logs).

## 🧪 Environment:
- OS: Windows 11 64-bit
- Node/Electron assumed based on .js structure
- RAM: 8GB
- SmartScreen: Enabled
