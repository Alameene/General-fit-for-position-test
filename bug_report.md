# 🐞 Bug Report

**Bug Type**: Critical

---

## 🔁 Playback Steps:
1. Extracted the provided installer.
2. Ran `broken_installer.exe` — only works if `Config` folder is present.
3. Attempted to run `debug.exe` inside `Config` — fails silently.
4. Reviewed `installation_path_code.js`, found this line:
   ```js
   <%= variable %> = installation_path();
   ```
5. This is invalid JavaScript and indicates improper build templating.

---

## 🧠 Analysis:
The game contains raw, uncompiled template code (`<%= %>`), which is not executable JavaScript.

This breaks the `installation_path_code.js` and may contribute to startup failure.

Additionally, `debug.exe` appears broken or non-functional without required code dependencies.

Beyond the issue in `installation_path_code.js`, the project includes **multiple source code files with incorrect syntax or placeholder templating

## ✅ Recommendation:
- Fix the templating engine or replace `<%= variable %>` with valid JavaScript, e.g.:
  ```js
  const variable = installation_path();
  ```
- Add file/folder existence checks before attempting execution.
- Ensure `debug.exe` handles missing components gracefully (or provide logs).

- Run all scripts through a build process that compiles templates into working JavaScript (e.g., Webpack, EJS render).

-Add a pre-packaging validation step to check:

-All files are executable.

-No placeholders (<%= %>, {{ }}, etc.) remain.

-Each script has valid syntax and structure.

-Test the final built game folder in a clean environment before release.

-Implement basic logging (e.g., to error.log) when startup fails — this makes bugs far easier to trace.
